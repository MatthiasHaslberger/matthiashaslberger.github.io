  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Taxing inheritances is an effective way of abating rising wealth inequality, yet across advanced economies inheritance tax rates have dropped significantly in recent decades. Why is it so difficult to politically address rising wealth inequality? To help answer this question we study preferences over inheritance taxation using an original survey from England and Wales. We argue that it is difficult to tax inheritances for two reasons. First, many people don't have strong preferences regarding inheritance taxation, and the people who do, are more likely to come from higher socio-economic groups. There is thus a paradox in that the people who would stand to gain the most from taxing inheritances are those least likely to have an opinion on it. Second, rising house prices mean that more people expect to pass on larger inheritances to their children and that more people expect to inherit larger estates, putting downward pressure on inheritance taxes. Using non-experimental and experimental methods, we show that homeowners with more expensive houses, and people whose parents own more expensive properties, are less supportive of inheritance taxation. After empirically demonstrating our argument, we examine what happens when we randomly inform people about the level of wealth inequality locally and/or nationally. We find that our information treatment does not alter peoples’ preferences: preferences over inheritance taxation appear sticky, making it difficult to mobilize political support to address rising wealth inequality. The paper helps explain why addressing rising wealth inequality is politically difficult and thereby contributes to an increasingly salient debate.

**Housing Wealth, Information, and Political Efficacy** \

It has long been established that education and income affect people's political efficacy. Surprisingly, the role of wealth has been largely neglected in this literature. This paper studies how home ownership and information about house price inequality affect respondents’ internal and external political efficacy, using a representative survey including an experiment that was administered in England and Wales in the summer of 2021. We find that housing wealth and perceived overall wealth are associated with increased internal and external efficacy. However, controlling for individual-level covariates, only perceived house value and overall wealth exert a statistically significant effect on political efficacy. Household income, education, and sex appear to be the more potent predictors of political efficacy. Furthermore, we see sizeable effects of our information treatments for internal efficacy, but not for external efficacy. In addition, the effect of receiving and understanding the treatments is positive, suggesting that informing people about the high levels of inequality in the housing market does not undermine efficacy in the way materialist theories of political behaviour and preference formation sometimes claim. Instead, we argue that comprehension rather than content of the information matters for internal efficacy.

This article deals with a central paradox in the occupational polarisation literature: most scholars accept that technological change is biased against routine-intensive occupations, but in many countries, we do not see the pattern of occupational polarisation that the theory usually predicts. I argue and show empirically using a dataset of 10 OECD countries between 1995 and 2013 that technological change is both routine-biased and skill-biased, but that the result of routine-biased technological change may be occupational upgrading rather than polar- isation. This is due to differences in occupational routine-wage hierarchies: only where routine occupations cluster around the middle of the wage distribution are we likely to see polarisation. Where routine occupations are concentrated near the bottom of the wage hierarchy, upgrading occupational change is the norm. Based on research on the US, the former has been widely assumed, but it does not hold true in all countries. Overall, this article shows that much previous work on routine-biased technological change and polarisation was built on premises that do not travel well. This underscores the importance of comparative research for building and testing robust general theories.

Which tasks workers perform on their jobs is critical for how technological change plays out in the labour market. This crucial insight sparked a large literature on routine-biased technological change which argues that routine occupations with a high share of repetitive and codifiable tasks are at risk of being automated. This paper makes the case for rethinking how we operationalise occupational task content. Based on survey data from 27 European countries between 2000 and 2015, I construct novel measures of routine task intensity and task complexity at the ISCO-88 2-digit level. Comparing them to existing operationalisations, I show that the proposed indices lead to improvements in several critical areas. The task dimensions have a straightforward theoretical interpretation as they capture the essence of the routine-bias and skill-bias arguments and are operationalised to better align theory and measurement. Furthermore, my indices create new opportunities for research by allowing researchers to analyse within-occupation change and country-differences in occupational task content. My paper can therefore contribute to a more sociologically informed understanding of technological change. The indices will benefit both sociologists and labour economists in investigating the nature of recent employment trends in Europe and formulating policies to deal with these challenges.
