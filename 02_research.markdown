**Why Is It So Hard to Counteract Rising Wealth Inequality? Evidence from a Survey Experiment in England and Wales** \

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

It has long been established that education and income affect people's political efficacy. Surprisingly, the role of wealth has been largely neglected in this literature. In this paper, we argue that housing wealth performs an insurance function and is thereby associated with higher internal and external political efficacy. Using data from the UKHLS and a representative survey including an experiment that was administered in England and Wales, we document a sizeable and statistically significant positive association of housing wealth and perceived wealth with efficacy. However, this relationship is less robust to sample attrition than between efficacy and education or income. We furthermore investigate whether informing respondents about house price inequality affects their efficacy. Our information treatments show no effect on external efficacy, while the effect on internal efficacy depends on the respondent correctly understanding the information: comprehenders show higher efficacy and non-comprehenders exhibit lower efficacy, compared to the control group. This suggests that views of government responsiveness (external efficacy) are not easily manipulated, while for people's view of their own understanding of politics (internal efficacy), comprehension matters more than content of the information treatment, in accordance with self-efficacy theory.

It has long been established that education and income affect people's political efficacy. Surprisingly, the role of wealth has been largely neglected in this literature. This paper studies how home ownership and information about house price inequality affect respondents’ internal and external political efficacy, using a representative survey including an experiment that was administered in England and Wales in the summer of 2021. We find that housing wealth and perceived overall wealth are associated with increased internal and external efficacy. However, controlling for individual-level covariates, only perceived house value and overall wealth exert a statistically significant effect on political efficacy. Household income, education, and sex appear to be the more potent predictors of political efficacy. Furthermore, we see sizeable effects of our information treatments for internal efficacy, but not for external efficacy. In addition, the effect of receiving and understanding the treatments is positive, suggesting that informing people about the high levels of inequality in the housing market does not undermine efficacy in the way materialist theories of political behaviour and preference formation sometimes claim. Instead, we argue that comprehension rather than content of the information matters for internal efficacy.

**Does Robotisation Increase Inequality between Manufacturing and Service Workers?** 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Robotisation is reshaping the political economy of labour markets and is attracting substantial interest from social scientists. Recent studies have found sometimes contradictory effects on aggregate employment and wages. Yet, the distributional consequences of robotisation at the occupational level remain under-theorised and under-investigated. In this paper, I use data from a panel of OECD countries from 1993 – 2016 to study whether robotisation has affected the relative wages of routine manufacturing occupations, which have been most exposed to robotisation, compared to other groups. I argue that, while robots reduce aggregate labour demand in exposed occupations, they enhance the productivity and hence wages of the remaining workers. However, my empirical analyses suggest that productivity gains from automation are not widely shared with workers. Instead, employment protection legislation appears to matter most for the relative fortunes of routine manufacturing and non-manufacturing workers.

**The Impact of Covid-19 on Occupational Tasks** 
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>

In this project, I investigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the organisation of work in Europe. Using newly available data from the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), I zoom in on how occupational task content has changed, with a particular focus on the routine intensity and complexity of occupations.

**Center-right Parties and Post-War Secondary Education**, *forthcoming*, *Journal of Comparative Politics*. \

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
The massification of secondary schooling constitutes the key educational project of the first post-war period. However, the resulting educational structures differed in terms of streaming and standardisation. Despite their historical opposition, center-right parties contributed to shaping these reforms. They opposed standardisation because their distributive strategy rested on support from elites and middle classes. However, their stance on streaming varied. Centre-right parties supported streaming when they were linked to teachers and private providers who opposed comprehensive reforms, but supported de-streaming where such groups aligned with the left. The analysis suggests that common partisan distributive aims can materialize as varied public service reforms, due their intersection with the productive environment. This paper shows these outcomes by tracing reforms shaped by center-right parties in Bavaria, France, and Italy.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
This article deals with a central paradox in the occupational polarisation literature: most scholars accept that technological change is biased against routine-intensive occupations, but in many countries, we do not see the pattern of occupational polarisation that the theory usually predicts. I argue and show empirically using a dataset of 10 OECD countries between 1995 and 2013 that technological change is both routine-biased and skill-biased, but that the result of routine-biased technological change may be occupational upgrading rather than polar- isation. This is due to differences in occupational routine-wage hierarchies: only where routine occupations cluster around the middle of the wage distribution are we likely to see polarisation. Where routine occupations are concentrated near the bottom of the wage hierarchy, upgrading occupational change is the norm. Based on research on the US, the former has been widely assumed, but it does not hold true in all countries. Overall, this article shows that much previous work on routine-biased technological change and polarisation was built on premises that do not travel well. This underscores the importance of comparative research for building and testing robust general theories.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

Which tasks workers perform on their jobs is critical for how technological change plays out in the labour market. This crucial insight sparked a large literature on routine-biased technological change which argues that routine occupations with a high share of repetitive and codifiable tasks are at risk of being automated. This paper makes the case for rethinking how we operationalise occupational task content. Based on survey data from 27 European countries between 2000 and 2015, I construct novel measures of routine task intensity and task complexity at the ISCO-88 2-digit level. Comparing them to existing operationalisations, I show that the proposed indices lead to improvements in several critical areas. The task dimensions have a straightforward theoretical interpretation as they capture the essence of the routine-bias and skill-bias arguments and are operationalised to better align theory and measurement. Furthermore, my indices create new opportunities for research by allowing researchers to analyse within-occupation change and country-differences in occupational task content. My paper can therefore contribute to a more sociologically informed understanding of technological change. The indices will benefit both sociologists and labour economists in investigating the nature of recent employment trends in Europe and formulating policies to deal with these challenges.
