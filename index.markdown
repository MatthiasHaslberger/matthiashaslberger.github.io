### Hi,

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Economics and Political Science at the University of St. Gallen where I work on the [GOVPET](https://ibb.unisg.ch/en/research-labs/govpet-leading-house/research-program/){:target="_blank"} project and an [Associate Member](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/sites/associate-members/){:target="_blank"} at Nuffield College, University of Oxford. My main research interests centre around the effects of artificial intelligence and technological change more broadly on labour markets and education systems. Furthermore, I am interested in the political causes and consequences of economic inequalities, with a particular focus on housing. 

I hold a PhD from the [Department of Social Policy and Intervention](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} at the University of Oxford. Before moving to St. Gallen, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, University of Oxford, and a Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/the-college/about-the-college/){:target="_blank"} where I worked on an ERC project on the politics of wealth inequality [(WEALTHPOL)](https://wealthpol.web.ox.ac.uk/about-project){:target="_blank"}.

My research uses a wide range of predominantly quantitative and experimental methods and has been published in *Comparative Politics*, *Research in Social Stratification and Mobility*, and *The Economic and Labour Relations Review*. 

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:matthias.haslberger@unisg.ch) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/matt_haslberger){:target="_blank"}.
