### Hi,

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Economics and Political Science at the University of St. Gallen where I am part of the [GOVPET](https://ibb.unisg.ch/en/research-labs/govpet-leading-house/research-program/){:target="_blank"} Leading House. My main research interests centre around the effects of artificial intelligence and technological change more broadly on labour markets and education systems. Furthermore, I am interested in the political causes and consequences of economic inequalities, with a particular focus on taxation and housing. **I am on the academic job market for 2025!**

I receiveed my PhD in Social Policy from the University of Oxford in 2022 and hold an MSc in Comparative Social Policy from the University of Oxford and a BA in Governance from the University of Freiburg. Before moving to St. Gallen, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher on the [(WEALTHPOL)](https://wealthpol.web.ox.ac.uk/about-project){:target="_blank"} ERC project at the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}, University of Oxford, and a Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/the-college/about-the-college/){:target="_blank"}, where I remain an [Associate Member](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/sites/associate-members/){:target="_blank"}.

My research is rooted in Comparative Political Economy, but straddles different social scientific disciplines and uses a wide range of predominantly quantitative and experimental methods. My work has been published in journals such as *World Politics*, *Journal of European Public Policy*, *Regulation & Governance*, *Journal of European Social Policy*, *Research in Social Stratification and Mobility*, and others. 

I believe that research should not be confined to the ivory tower and regularly engage with policymakers, practitioners, and journalists. 

If you are interested in my research, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:matthias.haslberger@unisg.ch) or [X](https://twitter.com/matt_haslberger){:target="_blank"}.
